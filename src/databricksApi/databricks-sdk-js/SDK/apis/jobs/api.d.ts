/**
 * The Jobs API allows you to create, edit, and delete jobs.
 *
 * You can use a Databricks job to run a data processing or data analysis task in
 * a Databricks cluster with scalable resources. Your job can consist of a single
 * task or can be a large, multi-task workflow with complex dependencies.
 * Databricks manages the task orchestration, cluster management, monitoring, and
 * error reporting for all of your jobs. You can run your jobs immediately or
 * periodically through an easy-to-use scheduling system. You can implement job
 * tasks using notebooks, JARS, Delta Live Tables pipelines, or Python, Scala,
 * Spark submit, and Java applications.
 *
 * You should never hard code secrets or store them in plain text. Use the
 * :service:secrets to manage secrets in the [Databricks CLI]. Use the [Secrets
 * utility] to reference secrets in notebooks and jobs.
